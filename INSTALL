Requirements:

* Python 2.6 or later (Python 3 not supported yet)

* Python Dateutil (http://labix.org/python-dateutil)

* Twisted 12.2.0 or later, http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/

* PostgreSQL (just needs a database)

Python and Twisted should be included in the package system in most recent
Linux distributions.

If you use a backend which uses SSH (JunOS, Force10), there is a patch to
remove some of the log statements in the Twisted SSH module, which is rather
noisy. This makes the log a lot easier to read.


Installation:

python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

Edit /etc/opennsa.conf. Configuring the service is relatively straightforward,
but creating the topology specification is still somewhat tricky.



Command line tool:

Make a reservation:
onsa reserve -u http://localhost:9080/NSI/services/ConnectionService -p OpenNSA-TestClient -r Aruba -s Aruba:A1 -d Aruba:A4

Do a ./onsa --help for more information.


Development

To start a test service:

twistd -noy opennsa.tac

Note that opennsa.conf must exists in the source directory for this to work.
