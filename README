OpenNSA is a reference implementation of the Network Service Agent, which
includes an NSI interface.

NSI (Network Service Interface) is (or should be) a protocol agnostic interface
for provisioning network links, i.e., providing networking as a service.

There are several documents concerning NSI. See the OGF work group page for the
latest revisions. http://forge.gridforum.org/sf/projects/nsi-wg

OpenNSA consists of several modules for various functionality. These include
topology database and parser, protocol handlers, and the core agent itself.

OpenNSA is currently in a state of heavy prototyping and nothing is set in
stone, and there are probably more temporary constructions in the code than
final.
