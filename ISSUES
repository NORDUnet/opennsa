Long term:
  Documentation :-)
  Persistence for connections
  Need an easy way to see active/scheduled/future connections
   - In general: Get information out of OpenNSA in an easily digestable way


General:

  Make CLI setup more like regular config to lessen confusion
  Seperate protocol stack from connection (done for provider, client still needs work)
  Deal with bandwidth in calendar (requires joint resource concept)
  Profiling of protocol stack / backends
  Failing to send reserveConf can keep connection in INITIAL
  connection.py and simplebackend.py steps on each others toes in scheduled teardown


Client:

  TLS for client service - URL creation is heuristic -> suck!
  Better connection names - use UUIDs for global ids


Backends:

  Multiple switches support
  NCS backend
  Force10: Should do shutdown when interfaces are not in use
  JunOS:
    Failure handling is terrible for command sending
    Log success/failure instead of commands (only on debug)
