Long term:
  Documentation :-)
  Persistence for connections
  Easy way of seeing connections in OpenNSA (basic web interface is there)
  Deal with bandwidth in calendar (requires joint resource concept)
  Ability to generate topology from NRM mapping / internal topology description

General:
  Seperate protocol stack from connection (done for provider, client still needs work)
  Profiling of protocol stack / backends
  Failing to send reserveConf can keep connection in INITIAL (cannot reproduce)
  Make RPC + callback timeout configurable
  Mailing list
  Implementation of AutoGOLE topology distribution scheme
  The NRM port code in gole is quite terrible
  Client should be able to breakout request itself
  The NRM parser/mapping in the gole module is brittle.
  Security params clean up (see mail from Jeroen)
  Better error messages for reservations with time in the past
  Better error messages for odd topology constructs (connect an SDP to itself)

Client:
  Better connection names - use UUIDs for global ids

Backends:
  Multiple backends support
  NCS backend
  Force10: Should do shutdown when interfaces are not in use
  Test on Juniper EX switch
  Test on Juniper virtual router
  JunOS:
    Failure handling is terrible for command sending
    Log success/failure instead of commands (only on debug)
  SSH module does not notifiy login timeouts
